# Autocomplete

Autocomplete is the [Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb) feature that displays previous search results based on current and previous searches. These results are presented in four different lists, which can be together or separated, depending on the customer's interaction. It includes:

- Top Searches.
- Search History.
- Search Suggestions.
- Product Suggestions.

During the interaction with the search bar, Intelligent Search immediately displays the set of Top Searches and Search History (if the customer has done searches before).

When the user starts typing, the system displays the Search suggestions and the Product suggestions and removes the previous lists.

You can read a detailed explanation of Autocomplete and its features in the [Autocomplete](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/4gXFsEWjF7QF7UtI2GAvhL) user guide.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have added the `search` app to your theme dependencies in the `manifest.json` as shown below:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.search": "2.x"
  }
```

Check the [Search](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.search) app documentation for more details on this step.

## Usage

Add `autocomplete-result-list.v2` into the blocks of a `search-bar`. We also recommend to set `openAutocompleteOnFocus` as shown.

```json
{
  "autocomplete-result-list.v2": {
    "blocks": ["product-summary"]
  },
  "search-bar": {
    "blocks": ["autocomplete-result-list.v2"],
    "props": {
      "openAutocompleteOnFocus": true
    }
  }
}
```
